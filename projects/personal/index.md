    <p>This is an overview over all my personal projects.</p>

## Home Assistant

I use Home Assistant for my smart home.

This is an ongoing project. Can these things even be final?

## My VPS

This is what I use almost daily.

Includes all the important services I need, just for me.

## ChronoDiff

A time calculator written in Go.

My first time actually using Go!
I thought it would be a nice starter project as I actually use it myself sometimes.
