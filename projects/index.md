# About my projects

I split my projects into two sections:

## :one: My personal projects

These are projects I have done just for myself.
I tend to experiment a lot with things I see on the internet and often decide "I want to try that myself".

## :two: My work projects

These are projects I have done for work.
Since I started as an IT trainee, most of my work has revolved around someone needing something done.
Often this results in a specific tool or program - a new project.
